### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Darsh Thakkar!

### :point_left: And this is kinda how I look on my best days (You think this was cheeky? Then you should see me code!)

[This will lead you](https://www.darshth.com) to my website if you want to know more about me!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project called ['The Code Vault'](https://www.darshth.com/the-code-vault) and my mission is to make Big Data Tools accessible to everyone. I think if we can give the power of Big Data to people who understand the Business Processes thoroughly, but don't have a formal coding background, we can benefit an organization immensely!

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I am not coding, I do poetry. [Here's a Narnia :door: :snowflake: door](https://www.darshth.com/interests) to my world outside of coding! 

- ðŸ‘¯ I love teaching and if you'd like to learn a little Machine Learning, Python, Data Science (Well, as much I know!), feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to help.

- :necktie: Here's how my Professional Experiences stack up:
  - Data Science Co-op Intern @Merck & Co. Inc. (September 2020 - December 2020)
  - Data Scientist G-RA @Rutgers University. (January 2020 - April 2020)
  - Data Scientist(Business Analysis) and Strategist @Sales Corner Baroda. (May 2018 - August 2019)
