### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Darsh Thakkar!

### :point_left: And this is kinda how I look on my best days.(If you think that was cheeky, you should see me code!)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project called 'The Code Vault' and my mission is to make Big Data Tools accessible to everyone. I think if we can give the power of Big Data to people who understand the Business Processes thoroughly, but don't have a formal coding background, we can benefit an organization immensely!
- - âš¡ Fun fact: When I am not coding, I do poetry. You can have a look at my work on [WORDPRESS](https://www.theuncannypoet.wordpress.com).
